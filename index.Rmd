I am an avid R user and learner for data wrangling, analysis, exploration, analysis, and visualization. I work with data and data tools almost daily as part of my job as a Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Advisor for a non-profit. This space is where I hope to consolidate all my writings and personal R projects going forward.
